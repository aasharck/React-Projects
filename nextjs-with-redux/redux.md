- Redux is a state management library
- In React you only have client side redux stores
- In Next.JS you can also fetch data on server side during SSR
- We create a new server side redux store in such cases and update it with fetched data
- HYDRATE action from next-redux-wrapper is triggered in such cases
- While handling HYDRATE action we need to apply the new store values to the client store
